**Bluefelt** is an open-source, cross-platform engine for building, hosting, and playing turn-based games.

## Key Features of Bluefelt

- **Radically Cross-Platform**: Play on any platform you want: clients for iOS, Android, the web, Steam and VR and can all play together in the same game. 

- **Expressive Game Authoring**: Bluefelt games are written in concise `.yaml` files which describe the entities, verbs, and rules. An entire game can be expressed in only a few hundred lines of code. View our [game developer guide](#) for more information.

- **Open-Source and Non-Commercial**: The Bluefelt platform is released under the Apache 2.0 license and governed by its community and maintainers. Our vision is to create a platform that is easy to join, free to use, and eternally independent from large corporations.

- **Protective of Creators**: While the platform itself is free and open, we protect the interests of game creators who bring new games into existence year after year. We work directly with copyright holders to protect their IP and help determine how their game is monetized.

- **Your Choice of Clients**: Bluefelt provides an official web experience compatible with a wide range of devices, but anybody can build a client to play games. View our [client developer guide](#) to learn how to build your own Bluefelt client.

- **Written in Modern Technologies**: Bluefelt servers run on Rust with custom game logic compiled to WebAssembly ensuring quick gameplay.

## Why Bluefelt?

Bluefelt is named after the blue felt-covered tables associated with high-class tabletop environments. It's a luxurious attention to detail which raises the aesthetic experience of playing a physical game.

Tabletop gaming was born in this physical realm. Online platforms have enabled these experiences reach beyond the table, but the **adaptation** to digital has always felt compromised. We lose the physicality and intimacy, but are still stuck with a user interface that is defined by the limitations of the physical game box.

The motivation behind Bluefelt is to take seriously the task of adapting tabletop experiences to digital mediums. We ask:
- **What is the essence behind the physical game**? 
- **What is the best implementation of that essence on the player's chosen device?**

The result is a game that's comfortable to play on phones, tablets, PCs and VR headsets. Players can join together wherever they're at to continue the game-playing experience. And familiar games can be experienced in a brand-new way on new categories of devices.

New platforms will come and go, but Bluefelt can power game experiences for the foreseeable future.
